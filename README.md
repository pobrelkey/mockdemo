In this repository:

* [Performance Comparison](https://github.com/pobrelkey/mockdemo/wiki/Performance-Comparison) - an informal performance comparison of various Java mocking libraries (executive summary: they all perform just fine).
* [Syntax Comparison](https://github.com/pobrelkey/mockdemo/wiki/Syntax-Comparison) - a walk-through of a set of mock unit tests as implemented in several different mocking libraries.
